To execute the developer tests, you have
to be in the source directory, just above
the build/ directory.

Make sure you have the release build for
loadnewquota.bin compiled.

Start the automated tests like so:
./developer_test/CPR-231093/devtest.ksh

(you may want to customize the variables
at the beginning of that script for e.g.
bigger, more realistic test datasets)
